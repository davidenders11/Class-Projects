## Part 1: Review

Because there will be a Midterm next week, there is no reading
and no quiz. Instead, you should spend some time review the course material.

I suggest asking yourself whether you can explain the following without referring to your notes. (E.g., what are they? What are their strengths and weaknesses? Why are they important or useful or interesting? What functionality do they support? For data structures, how are they
implemented, and what is the asymptotic running time of the operations? )

For items with stars, you do not necessarily need to know them in enough detail to code them from scratch, but you
should at least know what problem they are trying to solve and (at a high level) be able to explain how they work.
